# frontend-coding-challenge-by-Dev-Jangid

## Idea of the App
The task is to implement a small web app that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API is explained below).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It lists the most stared GitHub repositories for the last month, with infinite loading on scroll.

- Used [Antd](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) for styling the interface.
 
- Used [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#features) for Data Fetching
It basically a Promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.

- And [react-infinite-scroll-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) to implement the Infinite scroll.
